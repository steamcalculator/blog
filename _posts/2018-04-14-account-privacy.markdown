In case you are wondering why the calculation isn't working. Since yesterday Valve just made every Steam userâ€™s gaming library hidden by default. You can change it back by editing your settings.
Go to your profile settings, click on "My Privacy Settings" and set "Game details" and "Inventory" to "Public".
